# 🧱 Meta-Process for Brick Design

A clear, step-by-step workflow for consistently designing high-integrity Bricks using the **Output Brick Framework**.  

Steps (in brief)  
1. Do an initial Brick sketch
2. Go to Brickworks AI for refinement
3. Log well-designed brick into your system

---

## ✅ Step 1: Brick Sketch (Initial Draft by User)

Before engaging with Brickworks AI, explicitly sketch your Brick using this **Brick Design Template**:

### 📓 Brick Design Template *(fill this out first!)*

🧱 Brick Title:  
[Explicit, clear, outcome-oriented title here]

🎯 Clearly Defined Outcome:  
[Explicitly state exactly what completed success looks like.]

⚠️ Known or Anticipated Friction Points:  
[List clearly any high-friction, anxiety-inducing parts of this Brick.]

🧩 Initial Breakdown (Mini-Bricks to address friction):  
[Quickly sketch some initial ideas to directly address friction points.]

❓ Unclear or Open Questions:  
[List clearly what you haven't figured out yet, or what you explicitly need help refining.]



## 🤖 Step 2: Brickworks AI Refinement

Clearly paste both:

- Your filled-out **Brick Design Template**.
- The refined **Brickworks AI – Brick Design Prompt**.

Instruct Brickworks AI explicitly:

> "Here's my initial Brick sketch. Please help me clearly refine this Brick using the provided Brickworks AI prompt and explicitly address any unclear parts or friction points."

*(Brickworks AI explicitly helps refine and articulate your brick, clearly breaking down friction points into actionable Mini-Bricks.)*

## 📥 Step 3: Log and Schedule Brick

Immediately after refining your Brick:

- Explicitly log the Brick (and its Mini-Bricks) into your chosen productivity system (Todoist, Notion, etc.).
- Clearly schedule when you'll explicitly take action on the next Mini-Brick, or explicitly add it to your backlog for your next **weekly prep session** (Sundays).

---

## 🗓️ Weekly Prep (Sunday)

Regularly revisit your backlog explicitly on Sundays to:

- Clearly prioritize and schedule Bricks for the upcoming week.
- Clearly identify next Mini-Brick actions explicitly for each scheduled Brick.
