# üß± Meta-Process for Brick Design

A clear, step-by-step workflow for consistently designing high-integrity Bricks using the **Output Brick Framework**.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Brick Sketch (Initial Draft by User)

Before engaging with Brickworks AI, explicitly sketch your Brick using this **Brick Design Template**:

### üìì Brick Design Template *(fill this out first!)*

üß± Brick Title:
[Explicit, clear, outcome-oriented title here]

üéØ Clearly Defined Outcome:
[Explicitly state exactly what completed success looks like.]

‚ö†Ô∏è Known or Anticipated Friction Points:
[List clearly any high-friction, anxiety-inducing parts of this Brick.]

üß© Initial Breakdown (Mini-Bricks to address friction):
[Quickly sketch some initial ideas to directly address friction points.]

‚ùì Unclear or Open Questions:
[List clearly what you haven't figured out yet, or what you explicitly need help refining.]



## ü§ñ Step 2: Brickworks AI Refinement

Clearly paste both:

- Your filled-out **Brick Design Template**.
- The refined **Brickworks AI ‚Äì Brick Design Prompt**.

Instruct Brickworks AI explicitly:

> "Here's my initial Brick sketch. Please help me clearly refine this Brick using the provided Brickworks AI prompt and explicitly address any unclear parts or friction points."

*(Brickworks AI explicitly helps refine and articulate your brick, clearly breaking down friction points into actionable Mini-Bricks.)*

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Step 3: User Refinement (with AI Assistance)

Iterate explicitly with Brickworks AI until:

- Your Brick clearly has a refined, explicit title and clear completion criteria.
- Friction points have been clearly surfaced and explicitly addressed.
- Mini-Bricks are explicitly broken down and clearly scheduled or logged.

Brickworks AI explicitly provides a **grade and rationale** for your Brick design quality.

---

## üì• Step 4: Log and Schedule Brick

Immediately after refining your Brick:

- Explicitly log the Brick (and its Mini-Bricks) into your chosen productivity system (Todoist, Notion, etc.).
- Clearly schedule when you'll explicitly take action on the next Mini-Brick, or explicitly add it to your backlog for your next **weekly prep session** (Sundays).

---

## üóìÔ∏è Weekly Prep (Sunday)

Regularly revisit your backlog explicitly on Sundays to:

- Clearly prioritize and schedule Bricks for the upcoming week.
- Clearly identify next Mini-Brick actions explicitly for each scheduled Brick.
