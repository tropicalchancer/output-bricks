🎲 Urban Planner: The Productivity Game
Build your ideal city by completing real-world tasks ("Bricks") toward clear outcomes ("Buildings") within neighborhoods ("Urban Plans").

🌆 Game Objective
Build a thriving, well-balanced city by consistently completing Bricks, constructing Buildings, and growing your Neighborhoods.

🎯 How to Play
🗺️ Set Up Your City (Urban Plans)
Create your personal city with these Neighborhoods (or customize your own):

💰 Financial District

🏢 Business Center

🌳 Wellness Park

🏘️ Family Village

🎨 Arts & Culture District

🏡 Residential Zone

🌍 Civic Center

🏗️ Define Your Buildings (Outcomes)
For each Neighborhood, set clear, achievable Buildings with explicit outcomes. Each completed Building earns you points and expands your city.

Examples:

Neighborhood	Example Building	Points 🏅
💰 Financial District	Save $20,000 emergency fund	100 pts
🌳 Wellness Park	Complete a half-marathon	150 pts
🏢 Business Center	Promotion to Senior Manager	200 pts
(Adjust points based on your personal importance or difficulty.)

🧱 Complete Bricks to Build
Bricks are your clearly defined daily or weekly tasks that explicitly help construct your Buildings.

Scoring Bricks:

Each completed Brick: 5 points

Every 5 Bricks completed: Bonus +10 points

Completing all Bricks in a Building: Building points (see above)

Special Brick Bonuses:

Clearly high-friction or challenging Brick: +5 extra points

Brick explicitly supporting multiple Buildings: +5 extra points
