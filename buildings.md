# 🏢 Buildings: Clearly Define What Your Bricks Build Towards

**Buildings** are clear, larger outcomes toward which your individual **Bricks** explicitly contribute. This concept clearly integrates into the **Output Brick Framework**, ensuring that your productivity efforts have a purposeful and clearly articulated direction.

---

## 📐 What is a Building?

A **Building** represents a clearly defined, meaningful outcome or goal. It explicitly answers the question:

> *"What larger goal or outcome is this Brick explicitly contributing towards?"*

Each Building clearly defines success and explicitly clarifies why the smaller tasks (Bricks) matter.
