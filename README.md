# Output Bricks ðŸ§±

**A minimalist productivity framework for reliably tracking meaningful output and building unstoppable momentum.**

## ðŸ“¦ What is an Output Brick?

An **Output Brick** is a discrete, clearly defined unit of meaningful workâ€”completed, tangible, and measurable, just like running a mile or finishing a book.

Bricks accumulate daily, forming momentum toward consistent, prolific output.

## âœ… Brick Criteria

To qualify as an Output Brick, an action must be:

- **Discrete:** Clearly finished with no ambiguity.
- **Meaningful:** Directly moves important projects forward.
- **Effort-Agnostic:** Easy, medium, or hardâ€”all bricks count equally.

**Examples of Bricks:**

- Published a blog post
- Submitted a project proposal
- Shipped an MVP or update
- Cleared inbox backlog completely
